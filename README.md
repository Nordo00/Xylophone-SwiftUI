# Xylophone

## My Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to create a simple iOS application based on the Xylophone app at App Brewery (https://appbrewery.com/p/ios13-app-development-lessons). This was modified to use SwiftUI based on the ask of some of my friends. Please check out the App Brewery app development lessons, they are extremely good.


## What you will create

This is a fun little Xylophone app to impress your friends and family!
